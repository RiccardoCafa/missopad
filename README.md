# How to contribute

The whole project is hosted on firebase. The main credentials **will not work** on your local machine, so use the [Firebase Emulator](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite/connect_and_prototype) or your own project to run the app.

Please open a PR describing the changes and your new features. Any help will be much apreciated ðŸ˜€
